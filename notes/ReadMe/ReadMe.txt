If you used this script congrats! you're only half way there. 
		
		this script is not perfect by any standards and WILL net you errors and such. it's up to you now to fix the rest, and i can recommend you to use Dogscepter (if you even know what that is) to finish it off and do the rest manually.

		Happy Decompiling! -Melia

Any .gml files that were in the "code" folder (C:\Users\zylef\Desktop\New folder (3)\Sugary_Spire_2_26\\code) were used.
If you don't want this, rename the folder before re-running the script.
