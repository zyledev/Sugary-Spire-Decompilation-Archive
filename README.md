# Sugary Spire Playtest3.2 Decompilation
Took a few days! hope you enjoy!



# HOW TO INSTALL
1. find a GMLive gamemaker package, typically by either purchasing it from either [the gamemaker marketplace](https://marketplace.gamemaker.io/assets/5992/gmlive-gml-gms1-2-livecoding) or [itch.io](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gamemaker-live), or by getting it from a friend, either way, as long as you have it and it supports GM 2023.11 you're good.

2. Import the GMlive YYMPS package

3. Enjoy!


NOTE: make sure to use the 2023 runtimes, this has not been tested on any earlier or later runtimes.
another note: this is a WORK IN PROGRESS! any changes that I make I recommend you replicate for minimal issues.
